# Superbowls
**Updated and built upon existing Superbowl dataset from DataCamp.  Analysis of the games, tv viewership, and halftime performers.**

Added data through Superbowl 56 (2022). Created primary and foreign key relationships. Created additional tables to include all of the NFL teams with a unique identifier and a corresponding table to separate each team into their division. This will be useful in the exploratory analysis to include the teams who have never been to the superbowl and to compare the appearances, wins, losses, etc. by team and division.

Analysis of the superbowl schema to compare superbowl totals and records by team, division, quarterback, and coach. View the superbowls with the highest average viewers and the smallest and largest point differential. See how many games were played at different venues, in each city, and the number of times they were broadcast on each network. Compare the ad cost trends and which musicians have performed at the most superbowls.
